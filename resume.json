    "summary": "In 2011 I became the second developer at a VC-backed ecommerce startup in the 'sharing economy' space. That company was sold to Live Nation Entertainment in 2015, and I became Universe's Vice President, Engineering. If you've bought a ticket to a TechCrunch Disrupt recently, you've used us. I was its primary technical architect, and designed critical-path solutions for the company in key moments: from launching our first sale for Blizzard's Blizzcon (an infamously hard to scale event), to writing version one of our embedded checkout product - the essential reason for our later acquisiton. As a team of sixty today, we have a global presence with offices in San Francisco, Toronto, New York, and London. Independently of my leadership at Universe, I am a technologist at heart. Some of my original work in 2017 includes:  - Spring: A gallery installation in London, titled 'Corporeality'. Using images crawled from a large social media app, I trained a DCGAN to produce new instances of images to match the set. The end result was a haunting series of 'artifical' faces - ghost-like phantoms. - Summer: An Elixir-based interpreter for Urbit's Nock combinator VM as specified in their whitepaper (https://www.github.com/jdjkelly/martian  ) - Fall: A short-form decentralized messaging app built on Ethereum's contract event logs (https://www.github.com/jdjkelly/transponder)",
